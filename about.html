        <h1>Loved,Blessed,Highly Favoured!</h1>
        <p>Ever since I was a young girl I have loved cooking and making up recipes. 
            I started cooking when I was in grade 3.I would easily make african delicacies like ugali,mrenda,fish, omena etc.
            As an adult I have traversed pretty much all the cooking trends and all the while what I cooked day to day at home was a much pared back, 
            simpler style that better suited me and my family.Food that concentrated on flavour, 
            local ingredients in season, and was easy to prepare and cook. 
            This is the type of food that is most like me, and what I want to share.</p>

            <p>I live in Nairobi with my husband Don, who is a professional photographer,
            CEO and founder of Carlos.k.Photography. Together,We have three amazing kids who are 4, 3 and 1years. I am currently a Front Office Admin,
            A Software Engineer in the making since I am studying.
            I have the best job and it is nothing like what most people imagine an Admin does. I am also an entrepreneur, dealing in fish and household goods.
            A full time family cook, entertainer, domestic manager, listening ear, support and counsellor.</p>
            
            <p>This is my crew, love them to bits.</p>

            <p>I love to cook and my husband loves photography, 
                so a passion for both of us was born in this blog.</p>
